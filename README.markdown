# UK Arms Export Data

A list of all controlled goods approved or refused for export from the UK since January 2008.

The data is also available via a searchable application on the [Campaign Against Arms Trade](http://www.caat.org.uk/resources/export-licences) website.

Source data from the [Strategic Export Controls database](https://www.exportcontroldb.berr.gov.uk/eng/fox) of the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.

## Included Files

-   *items.csv* - Items approved, revoked or refused for export to specific countries
-   *values.csv* - Values in GBP, and rating codes of goods approved for export to specific countries
-   *ratings.csv* - Explanations of rating codes, and whether they are considered "military" or "dual-use"
-   *sources.csv* - Source countries of items transiting the UK to a third country
-   *destinations.csv* - Final destination countries for items incorporated into overseas equipment for onward export
-   *refusal-criteria.csv* - Reasons given for the refusal of licence applications

## Cross referencing

Several files contain a column named "licence_group" which lists unique licence IDs for cross referencing.

## Caveats

Due to ambiguity in the source documents from which these data were compiled, the following columns may include some inaccuracies.

-   Refusal criteria may contain some false-positive matches.
-   Source and destination countries may contain some false-positive matches.
-   Low price values may be inaccurate by one or two pounds.
